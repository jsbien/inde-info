http://hg.code.sf.net/p/PROJECTNAME/REPOSITORY/

(replace PROJECTNAME with the UNIX group name of the project, and the default REPOSITORY is 'code')

Building Poliqarp Debian packages
=================================

http://serverfault.com/questions/127625/given-a-debian-source-package-how-do-i-install-the-build-deps

pbuilder (and others)

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PbuilderHowto

apt-get install pbuilder debootstrap devscripts

NOTE: devscripts is not necessary to install along with pbuilder,
however if you are serious about using pbuilder and creating and
maintaining packages for Ubuntu or Debian, you will want to install
devscripts.

pbuilder create

To more closely mimic the environment of the official build machines, you can use the '--variant=buildd' option when creating the base tarball.

sudo pbuilder create --debootstrapopts --variant=buildd

The buildd variant will install the build-essential packages in the chroot environment, which is probably what you want, since you will be compiling packages.

If you want to build Debian packages on Ubuntu, you need to install Debian archive keys and add Debian distribution name, Debian mirror and key location to pbuilder command line like this:

sudo apt-get install debian-archive-keyring


sudo pbuilder create --distribution squeeze --mirror ftp://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ --debootstrapopts "--keyring=/usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg"

https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/build.en.html

 Let's customize the pbuilder package as follows:

    setting the /var/cache/pbuilder/result directory writable by your user account.

    creating a directory, e.g. /var/cache/pbuilder/hooks, writable by the user, to place hook scripts in.

    configuring ~/.pbuilderrc or /etc/pbuilderrc to include the following.

AUTO_DEBSIGN=${AUTO_DEBSIGN:-no}
HOOKDIR=/var/cache/pbuilder/hooks

irst let's initialize the local pbuilder chroot system as follows:

$ sudo pbuilder create

 If you have an updated source tree but have not generated the matching source package, issue the following commands in the source directory where the debian directory exists, instead:

$ sudo pbuilder --update
$ pdebuild

 pbuilder-satisfydepends-dummy : Depends: python-support which is a virtual package and is not provided by any available package

                                 Depends: openjdk-7-jdk which is a virtual package and is not provided by any available package
 or
                                          openjdk-6-jdk which is a virtual package and is not provided by any available package
 or
                                          sun-java6-jdk which is a virtual package and is not provided by any available package
 or
                                          sun-java5-jdk which is a virtual package and is not provided by any available package

                                          sun-j2sdk1.5 which is a virtual package and is not provided by any available package


python-support was removed from Debian and later from Ubuntu. Please use dh_python2 from dh-python package instead.
